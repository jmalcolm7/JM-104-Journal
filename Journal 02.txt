Google Algorithm on society having too much power? Comment and ReflectI feel that with Google’s Algorithm, it does have quite a large effect on society on a broad scale. Starting off with the success of businesses, the ranking system really affects the positions of the results whether it’s the first page or 10th page. Due to this, companies who are much larger than smaller companies will benefit from customers more meaning small companies have to contact customers themselves more directly, rather than customers finding them. With the amount of power Google has, like any other major company, they’ll most likely exploit that power to their advantage. In certain circumstances, Google can manipulate algorithms to hide secrets from the public such as government documents, educational systems, politics etc. I feel that Google plays a role in this because they can make information available to the public to some degree controlling what people know, search and consume. During the podcast, it stated that Google would only speak to you if you give or stop giving them money, most likely in relation to the process of deleting yourself Google’s search results that criminals or people with dark pasts may use. This also plays into the Government, C.I.A and other high organisations can use Google to tone down controversial topics like race, gender, class and history etc. if they feel that it’s too much for society to handle. On the other end of the spectrum, Google’s algorithm can be used for educational purposes for students or just for personal research. However this plays back into what was mentioned before how Google can control what goes out on the web in terms of searching for specific information.
