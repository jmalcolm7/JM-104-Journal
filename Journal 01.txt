The Methods and Ethics of GCHQ surveillance
 
GHCQ particularly interests me because I love watching documentaries on the Government when it comes to privacy, security or anything considered controversial in the eyes of the public, i.e. Edward Snowden and the C.I. The topic of GCHQ interests me a lot because of the previous events of documents being leaked on how they use the Internet to manipulate the public on how they think and act (techdirt.com, 2014). Edward Snowden, who leaked the documents is the main figure in this scandal because without him, the documents wouldn’t have been discovered and the public would’ve been oblivious to what GHCQ are doing (techdirt.com, 2014). 
 
This topic really impacts society because I believe with technology being a bridge form person to person and country-to-country, it is a lot harder for governments to hide things when confidential documents get leaked. On the flip side, it’s good because it means when things get leaked whether it is about security, privacy etc. people become more aware of what is happening with government. Due to most members of the public who are still in the dark about surveillance systems, privacy violations through the government and controversial tensions including race/gender/class discriminations and more. 
 
For me personally, it doesn’t impact me deeply because of my knowledge about government surveillance systems etc. through documentaries. However it was impactful in a way because the documents state that they specifically use the Internet as way to direct citizen behavior and thoughts through social media mediums. Taking a rough guess, around 70-80% what we see on the Internet that we find interesting may only be there to embed our subconscious minds with ideals that GHCQ want us to believe and act upon.
