GithubGithub is both an online and desktop program where a creative group of people working on a project can work and share together their work without the use of usb or having to send emails etc. Only using Github for a few weeks, It wouldn’t be my first choice as they're much easier ways to share work such as Google Drive and Onedrive. This is because with Google Drive/Onedrive all you need to do to share work is add someone’s email in the sharing option, add files and you don’t need to do anything else after that. However with Github, you need to keep going into Terminal to pull and obtain new files/folders which although people may get the hang of it eventually but for new people working in the industry it could be a hassle to learn as technical people would grasp it a lot quicker than opposed to people who are more creative. Github is widely used worldwide including governments, companies is Australia, Europe Japan, Canada Brazil and more. Facebook who is a major social uses github for various reasons. Facebook uses Github for such purposes such as tests, scripts, sources, bots and many more (Github.Facebook, 2016). They also have a repository called React Native which s a framework that is used for building apps with React which is used for Android (React Android). They also have scripts and code for all sorts of purposes like Facebook’s website, mobile devices, security etc. This is very useful because it means, coders all over Facebook can Github alongside with Terminal to pull new scripts with ease without having to email etc which means people can work effectively. References"Facebook".
